        <p>
        Although Selene was now familiar with the trials and tribulations of pregnancy and childbirth, she had been fortunate that Zarek's was easy. His brother's, however, was not.
        <br>
        <br>
        She had frequent discomfort, more intense sickness, and her moods were always volatile. Once, she even screamed at me after dinner when I offered to assist her to her bed. Of course, she didn't mean it and apologized.
        <br>
        <br>
        As the time for the baby to arrive drew near, it was clear to the midwives that he had turned to an awkward and dangerous position.
        <br>
        <br>
        Selene was outraged at the idea of a cesarean birth. It was, thankfully, unnecessary. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Encouraged by natural means, he turned the right way just hours before Selene went into labor.
        <br>
        <br>
        Born only a couple of years after his brother, Xal came into the family a healthy and somewhat larger baby than expected.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was clear Xal would take after his father more than his mother. In more ways than one from what I saw.
        <br>
        <br>
        Xal arrived shortly before a somewhat unpleasant time came upon his homeland, as Mauritania became embroiled in conflict with primitive tribes that refused to accept the newly installed rulers who sought to bring them into a more unified culture.
        </p>

        <p>
        This led to uprisings and violent clashes with numerous Roman garrisons across the land.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rome sent additional forces to assist, and over the course of Xal's first year and a half of life, most of the unruly tribes were either destroyed or fell in line.
        <br>
        <br>
        At the end of the campaign, a boy was brought to the palace at Caesarea, along with several others from his tribe.
        <br>
        <br>
        The soldiers said they saved him from a fate, truly no child deserves, at the hands of his tribesmen—a tribe of cannibals and savages in a remote part of the realm.
        <br>
        <br>
        While the others were sent away to new lives, it was obvious the boy had no one to care for him. He was a little older than Zarek and couldn't speak.
        </p>

        <p>
        The monsters in his tribe had cut out his tongue before our men rescued him from a ghastly ceremony.
        <br>
        <br>
        Juba and Selene decided he would remain in the palace and receive training to serve the royal household. Withdrawn and frightened at first, he was soon coaxed out of his shell and slowly began his new life.
        <br>
        <br>
        As the boy grew, so did Xal. Within a year, the two had become inseparable. Tor, as he came to be known, understood that Xal was part of an important family.
        <br>
        <br>
        While he learned to serve all, he paid special attention to Xal. After several years, Juba asked Xal if he wished to take Tor as his personal servus.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm told the two of them talked it over for several hours before they both agreed.
        <br>
        <br>
        From then on, wherever Xal went, Tor was by his side. They had both learned new methods of communicating and were educated together for the most part.
        <br>
        <br>
        Juba took it upon himself to educate them. Selene thinks her husband looks at Tor as a third son.
        <br>
        <br>
        In their education, Xal discovered his love of numbers. He found mathematics, both basic and advanced, to be quite easy.
        </p>

        <p>
        This led him to eventually serve his parents as financial Procurator. However, it wasn't all he would do with his life.
        <br>
        <br>
        His parents had numerous advisors who managed various aspects of the realm, one of whom Xal took a shine to as a boy and apprenticed under.
        <br>
        <br>
        He was the financial Procurator at the time, but he was less than happy with the job. One of his displeasures was the mining overseer—a most unsavory man.
       </p>

        <p>
        When Xal took over as the Procurator, he investigated the mining operations and discovered the overseer had been far worse than any had thought—missing gold, abused workers, and the overseer was living in the lap of luxury as a result.
        <br>
        <br>
        Xal took a contingent of guards to the man's home, had him thrown in prison, seized his assets, ensured the workers had time off and treatment for the abuses they suffered, and overhauled the entire mining operation.
        <br>
        <br>
        This resulted in better work conditions, increased yields, and improved mining safety and efficiency. Selene, impressed by her son's initiative, had him named Procurator Metallorum.
       </p>

        <p>
        Only a few years later, after Damion's appointment as Pater Famiglia, he noted Xal's accomplishments and offered him the chance to make similar assessments and reforms to all Antonius mining endeavors across the empire.
        <br>
        <br>
        Xal was eager to prove himself and accepted the offer.
        <br>
        <br>
        To facilitate ease of access to all the mines, Damion invited Xal to reside at the family estate here on Ilva and conduct his work from here.
        <br>
        <br>
        Of course, he had visited several times before, but seeing him still makes me happy.
       </p>

        <p>
        He has always been a sweet boy, and now a very kind and gentle man. Not to say that he is weak—far from it!
        <br>
        <br>
        His training included combat and riding and he has the physique of a battle-hardened commander.
        <br>
        <br>
        Not to mention, I think one trait his mother gave him was that temper. Though I've only seen it once, when a self-important functionary got on his nerves.
        <br>
        <br>
        Tor, as he always does, calmed him almost instantly.
       </p>

        <p>
        Now, Xal is to and fro with his work. I sometimes think I'll join Marcus before I see him again, but somehow, almost as if he heard my thoughts, he returns home.
        <br>
        <br>
        He has come to see me as a grandmother more since he came to live with us. As he should.
        <br>
        <br>
        He always makes time to spend with me, talking, laughing.
        <br>
        <br>
        That boy even has the audacity to flirt with me. Sometimes shamelessly!
        <br>
        <br>
        How I adore him.
