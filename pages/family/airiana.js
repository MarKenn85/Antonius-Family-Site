      <p>
      How can I describe this daughter of mine?! Sometimes I question whether she is truly one of my own blood—or if she’s some mischievous spirit sent to test my patience.
      <br>
      <br>
      She is brash, immodest, frivolous, utterly irresponsible, and seemingly a slave to her own carnal desires.
      <br>
      <br>
      Yet, something tells me her father would have quietly approved. He was a man of unrelenting passion, a lover of life’s pleasures, and unapologetically indulgent in his desires.
      <br>
      <br>
      His charm was magnetic, his appetite insatiable, and his ability to captivate those around him unmatched—helped, in no small part, by the impressive 'assets' he wielded with skill and unshakable confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
      From the front, his striking looks made eye contact a rare achievement—most found their gaze drifting downward. From behind, well, let’s just say he left admirers equally spellbound.
      <br>
      <br>
      And yet, I see echoes of him in her. It’s as though his spirit shapes her boldness and relentless charm in ways I struggle to grasp. Her nature is undeniable, and it manifests in every choice she makes, every action that catches me off guard.
      <br>
      <br>
      She also demonstrates traits that fly in the face of such base characteristics. She is kind, considerate, helpful to those she sees in need, and a fierce defender of her family.
      <br>
      <br>
      Though I must admit, I am baffled when she brandishes a knife and declares, "Imma cut a bitch if you don't back off." Exactly the kind of diplomacy Rome is known for. Or… something like that.
      </p>

      <p>
      Her escapades have become the stuff of legend in the household—or, as Alessandro has muttered more than once, a disruptive force worthy of military strategy among his weary soldiers, who seem to spend as much time discussing her as they do their training.
      <br>
      <br>
      And as unpredictable as her antics are, they are every bit as exhausting for my nerves.
      <br>
      <br>
      Her flair for the unconventional has been evident for as long as I can remember—even in the name she now insists on using. She was born Antonia—a name steeped in Roman tradition, one that should have carried the weight of her lineage.
      <br>
      <br>
      But tradition has never been her concern. Instead, she insists on being called Airiana—a name that, well, not exactly Roman standard, is it!
      </p>

      <p>
      The story goes back to her childhood, during a diplomatic and trade expedition to the far north-east—a land of bone-chilling cold and endless snow—where she caught the attention of everyone around her.
      <br>
      <br>
      Placed under strict guard at all times, she should have been daunted by the biting air and unfamiliar surroundings. Instead, young Antonia moved through it all with an unshakable curiosity, fascinated by the strange markets and foreign people.
      <br>
      <br>
      As the story was told to me upon her return, she encountered a kind merchant woman during her exploration. Before parting, Antonia asked the woman her name. “Airiana,” she replied in her bold accent.
      </p>

      <p>
      That single moment seemed to captivate her. From then on, Antonia declared that she would be Airiana too, much to the confusion and bemusement of everyone around her. And she has remained steadfast in that decision ever since.
      <br>
      <br>
      Her flights of fancy are, shall we say, pervasive. If she isn’t shopping with her sisters, she’s off exploring the provinces, hunting for the finest male specimens to satisfy her endless curiosity—and her equally endless appetite.
      <br>
      <br>
      She even colors her hair to a hue that seems almost snow white, just to appear more exotic and foreign to any man she meets. I often wonder if she’s trying to outshine the snow itself—or perhaps she’s just daring the cold to notice her.
      </p>

      <p>
      The clothes, if you can call them that, are of the finest materials, yet of the smallest sizes and proportions. It is a wonder she does not take ill from the chill in the air.
      <br>
      <br>
      I cannot count the number of times I have asked for her, only to be met with a weary shake of the head before I sigh and say, "Have you checked the ludus?!"
      <br>
      <br>
      Whenever I ask her why she insists on behaving this way, she tells me, "The control of a man truly lies in his balls, mother" —as if that’s supposed to reassure me.
      <br>
      <br>
      "Control them, and you’ll have him meeting every whim and need you could possibly think of. He’ll worship you. He’ll give you anything you want. He’ll even kill for you, if you ask."
      </p>

      <p>
      However, for all the ways she worries me, I cannot help but admire her. She is unafraid, unapologetic—she knows herself and her capabilities. She steps where others hesitate, moving with effortless charm and certainty, bending the world to her will.
      <br>
      <br>
      She makes even the most dire situations seem inconsequential, a fleeting inconvenience rather than something to be feared. And sometimes, I admit, I envy her—not just her freedom or her defiance, but the ease with which she disregards the weight of expectation.
      <br>
      <br>
      Where I am bound by duty, she moves unburdened, laughing in the face of tradition.
      <br>
      <br>
      She will always be my wild child.
