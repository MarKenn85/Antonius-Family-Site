        <p>
        While Damion may lead our family, he wasn't always a leader. As a child, he deferred quite often to his older sister.
        <br>
        <br>
        They were born only a year apart, but that was more than enough for Filipa to wind her brother around her finger with ease.
        <br>
        <br>
        Filipa saw herself as the superior Antonius, and she made sure Damion knew it. The boy would follow her everywhere, acting as her servus, catering to her whims as they entered her mind.
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite our best efforts to discourage this behavior, it continued for several years throughout their childhood.
        </p>

        <p>
        Eventually, however, Damion grew to realize that he was more equal to his sister than he first believed, and began to pull away from her influence.
        <br>
        <br>
        While it could never be said that the two 'liked' each other, it was obvious that Filipa saw herself as something of a role model for her baby brother.
        <br>
        <br>
        Her education took her primarily to Athens, where she studied the arts and sciences. She quickly became enamored with theatrical performance and attended the Amphitheater regularly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes she was even invited to perform with the actors or read sonnets to the gathered audience.
        </p>

        <p>
        I remember seeing one of her performances and feeling so many emotions. She was marvelous.
        <br>
        <br>
        The main focus of her education eventually turned to architecture. Her letters home would speak of technical details regarding construction, or the finer points of decorative entablatures adorning rooflines.
        <br>
        <br>
        In time, her studies left her as one of the preeminent designers of buildings in Rome.
        <br>
        <br>
        This has amplified her fame and renown throughout the empire. Not only as an Antonius, but as a builder of Roman architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
        Even the Emperor sought her out when the time came to rebuild structures in the capital. In a way, I suppose, Filipa has left a greater mark on Roman society than most people could ever hope to.
        <br>
        <br>
        I often wondered how she could have arrived at such a place where she would endeavor to become an artist such as she has.
        <br>
        <br>
        I talked with her about it one day, and she told me that it was, surprisingly, Selene who inspired her pursuit of the arts.
        <br>
        <br>
        She must have read my blank look of incomprehension as she continued, saying that Selene chooses her own path, her own fate, in so many ways.
        </p>

        <p>
        While she may be bound to the rules of Roman society, she never allows them to dictate her future completely.
        <br>
        <br>
        Of course, this choice of vocation meant that she rarely returns home. To the point that when it came time for her to marry, she couldn't even attend the announcement.
        <br>
        <br>
        Her mother had to write to her to ensure she was informed. Sadly, this did lead to some initial anger and resentment from Filipa, but they eventually reconciled after a few years.
        <br>
        <br>
        Speaking of her marriage, my brother needed an alliance with the kingdoms attached to the province of Egypt, namely Nubia. But the means of obtaining it were... less than standard, or ideal.
        </p>

        <p>
        As they grew, Filipa and Damion developed a rivalry that, while worrisome, is almost endearing years later. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Initially, Damion resented how she had treated him as a child, and when he heard about plans to marry her off to the King of Nubia, he did what some in the family considered appalling, though others found it rather humorous.
        <br>
        <br>
        The two had taken to sneaking very small amounts of poison into each other's wine regularly.
        <br>
        <br>
        While harmless in small amounts, the act of dosing the wine gave Damion the opening one night to add a sleeping draft.
        </p>

        <p>
        Filipa went to sleep in her chambers that night and woke up in a convoy halfway across the deserts of Egypt.
        <br>
        <br>
        Damion had arranged for her to be shipped to Nubia with a letter to the King that included the proposed alliance by marriage from the Emperor. That boy!
        <br>
        <br>
        Much to Filipa's contempt, the King agreed and married her shortly after the convoy arrived.
        <br>
        <br>
        I received letters from her after that, speaking of her "incarceration" under the King's rule. That he was a brute and a savage and unworthy of an Antonius. At least, initially!
        </p>

        <p>
        As time went by, the letters began to show her acclimation to life as a Nubian Queen.
        <br>
        <br>
        She found her freedoms greater than she had first thought, and the King wasn't as brutish as she had first surmised. One day, she even told us of her first child. She almost sounded happy, but not quite.
        <br>
        <br>
        Returning to Rome only a few years later, she seemed... more relaxed.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I commented about it, she looked off towards the sea, gave a faint smile, and spoke barely above a whisper, "They say size is meaningless!" She turned back to me and said “They’re completely wrong!” she smiled, winked with a soft giggle.
        </p>

        <p>
        While I didn't really understand, something told me she had a better time in Nubia than she would ever let on.
        <br>
        <br>
        Though she has made it clear to us that she still harbors bitterness for her brother's actions years prior, she has maintained a civil relationship with him.
        <br>
        They still speak of wine and laugh with each other. At least, when she's home. I admit, I miss her. She has returned to her creative endeavors as an architect and builder.
        <br>
        <br>
        Her projects take her to all the provinces of the empire where she plants a mark in the earth, not only for Rome but also for the Antonii.
        <br>
        <br>
        I suspect our legacy will live on through her works as much as anyone else's efforts.
