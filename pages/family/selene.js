      <p>
      I am, perhaps, somewhat biased in saying that Selene is one of the brightest young women I have ever encountered—second only to her mother. From the moment I saw her in Rome, paraded through the streets alongside her siblings by my brother, I knew she would grow into someone extraordinary.
      <br>
      <br>
      She has proven me correct in many ways. Even as a child, she carried herself with the poise and grace of an Egyptian queen, and when she came into my household, she learned to do the equivalent as a Roman noblewoman. Taking the finer points of both, she has created a truly captivating aura around her.
      <br>
      <br>
      She adapted quickly to her new life in Rome. Though Egyptian-born, she never forgot how different she was—nor did the world around her.
      </p>

      <p>
      I remember our private conversations, where she spoke of feeling isolated, even in a crowd. That sense of otherness stayed with her, but she never let it show. Over time, it became her strength.
      <br>
      <br>
      She not only stood out but stood above those around her. And now, she holds herself to the same untouchable standard as her mother—utterly unattainable.
      <br>
      <br>
      I watched her grow alongside Juba II, a young boy taken into the household of my great-uncle, Julius Caesar, after he defeated Juba I of Numidia.
      <br>
      <br>
      Caesar ensured that the child learned Greek and Latin, granted him Roman citizenship, and nurtured his education until, by the age of twenty, he was among the most enlightened men of his generation.
      </p>

      <p>
      Juba impressed me greatly—an erudite, ambitious young man who seemed the perfect match for Selene. When Octavian granted him the kingdom of Mauretania, I arranged for their marriage.
      <br>
      <br>
      As a wedding gift, Numidia’s lands were merged into his newly acquired territory, strengthening his rule.
      <br>
      <br>
      Selene was still a teenager when she became Queen, but her mind was sharp from her extensive education in Alexandria, and she proved herself an intellectual match for Juba. I always felt they developed a rapport that served them well for many years, both in rule and in life.
      <br>
      <br>
      After their marriage, they moved to their new capital city across the sea and renamed it Caesarea. Here, Selene proved to be a vital part of turning Mauretania into an organized economic leader.
      </p>

      <p>
      She and Juba developed trade and exports that have brought great prosperity to the region.
      <br>
      <br>
      Her letters to me are always accompanied by extravagant gifts—gold, purple fabrics, treasures fit for royalty. They are filled with accounts of her latest achievements, and every word fills me with pride.
      <br>
      <br>
      Indeed, I have no doubt that her parents would have been proud to see her flourish.
      <br>
      <br>
      Named by her father for the Greek goddess of the Moon and forever regarded as the Daughter of Isis, she understands the weight of her lineage.
      </p>

      <p>
      Though forbidden by Octavian from ever setting foot in Egypt in any official capacity, I suspect she has maintained subtle and clandestine ties to her homeland.
      <br>
      <br>
      There are signs—signs I cannot ignore. She brought members of her mother’s court into her own, perhaps for sentimental reasons, but perhaps for more.
      <br>
      <br>
      When I visited her in Caesarea, I noticed objects within her chambers that could only have come from Egypt. When I asked, she simply smiled and said, “I had them imported.”
      <br>
      <br>
      Her cunning and guile have served her well in ways I did not anticipate. Her reach within Mauretania is strong—perhaps stronger than any of us realize.
      </p>

      <p>
      She has also developed a taste for the finest things the world has to offer. Gold, above all, is her constant companion.
      <br>
      <br>
      No matter what she wears, gold is always present. Gems and precious stones fill her collection, dazzling her chambers and adorning her attire.
      <br>
      <br>
      Selene often travels with her sisters, Airiana and Antonia, journeying to far-flung provinces to acquire new imports before they reach Rome.
      <br>
      <br>
      They continue to shape the tastes of the elite, admired for their adornments—the fine fabrics, the rich dyes, the gold and jewels that never leave their persons.
      <br>
      <br>
      Her legacy is unfolding before our eyes, destined to endure as one of the greatest of our time.
