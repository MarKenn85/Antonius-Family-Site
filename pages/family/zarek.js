        When Selene told me she was pregnant with her first child, I was elated for her and Juba. Though, I cannot say that she was as enthused by the prospect.
        <br>
        <br>
        The concept of her belly getting so big was not her idea of appealing.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, after she went into seclusion during the second month of her pregnancy, she appeared again seven months later with a beautiful, healthy baby in her arms, and the family rejoiced.
        <br>
        <br>
        Zarek, as they named him, was born in Caesarea and raised with all the privileges a royal child could ever expect.
        </p>

        <p>
        Thankfully, his upbringing did not go to his head, and he grew into a fine young man.
        <br>
        <br>
        Of course, his parents brought him to Rome as a child and introduced him to the larger family. I was ecstatic to meet the young boy and spoiled him with treats and affection.
        <br>
        <br>
        During his stay with us, he showed interest in the political scene. He was too young to become involved in any way, but we took note of it for later.
        <br>
        <br>
        While Selene was attentive to her son, she didn't have the same parental instincts as her husband's. So, Juba had more to do with Zarek's formative years, raising him to be kind and considerate of others, as well as ensuring his education was equal to his own.
        </p>

        <p>
        I can't say I've heard of a father quite so attentive and loving towards his child. Once again, Juba impressed me.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is not to say Selene was absent. Quite the opposite, she had a great influence on Zarek as he got older.
        <br>
        <br>
        She brought her son on journeys to all the far-flung reaches of her domain, helping him understand the way the world works by showing him firsthand.
        <br>
        <br>
        He had to learn some understandably difficult lessons, but his mother helped him come to terms.
        <br>
        <br>
        Their travels together took them to Egypt, Greece, Macedonia, and west to Hispania.
        </p>

        <p>
        Thus, his education and understanding of the world and its diverse cultures expanded—perhaps even more than his father's.
        <br>
        <br>
        Even though she didn't quite know what to do with him when he was a child, she was still able to form a strong bond and become very close with Zarek as he grew from teenager to young adult.
        <br>
        <br>
        She also managed to fuel his love of gold and all things shiny.
        <br>
        <br>
        I can scarcely remember a time when I have not seen him dripping in gold and precious gems.
        </p>

        <p>
        Although, I do think he's spent a certain amount of time with his Aunt Airiana, as his garments have gotten smaller and smaller as the years have gone by.
        <br>
        <br>
        Eventually, his childhood interest in politics manifested more fervently.
        <br>
        <br>
        His father taught him a great deal, and Selene gave him another, unique perspective that would eventually serve him well as he took on more responsibilities and entered the political arena.
        <br>
        <br>
        He was trained in the martial forms of sword and shield, as well as learning to ride with expert equestrians. I recall one of his visits to Rome, where I saw him ride with his cousin Damion.
        </p>

        <p>
        We had visited friends at one of the nearby estates, and they offered the boys to ride their prized steeds.
        <br>
        <br>
        They had such fun that day. I am gratified that the two of them formed a strong bond over the years.
        <br>
        <br>
        Zarek's political interests have now led him to heights I did not expect, but I was glad to support and endorse his appointment as Senator of Romanum.
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite others in the senate finding him.. difficult, at times—gods know why—he has carried himself with the greatest dignity and holds great respect for his fellow senators and, of course, the Emperor.
        </p>

        <p>
        His detractors are clearly clamoring for anything to undermine the Antonius name in any way they can. It is the way of things. Zarek stands tall and holds our position with a firm hand.

        With his position in the senate, he has now moved from his childhood home and lives with us here at the Antonius estate, while also acting as Scribe for the family.

        <p>
        Damion has come to count on him and finds his counsel invaluable.
        <br>
        <br>
        During the time spent at home, he is often engaged with one of his favorite activities: dance. It's something he discovered at an early age. He loves creating new dances and movements.
        <br>
        <br>
        I still remember him sweeping me across the floor one evening at a party. I felt like a young girl again in his arms. It was thrilling to dance with him.
        <br>
        <br>
        Juba and Selene have also provided Zarek with siblings. I am sure Xal and Batresh look up to him, and I have no doubt that he has been the ideal role model for them.
        </p>

        <p>
        I know for myself, watching his growth and ambitions come to fruition has been quite inspiring.
        <br>
        <br>
        I cannot speak highly enough of this wonderful young man. His strength and grace have led him to find his place among the highest of all Romans.
        <br>
        <br>
        His spirit has brought the family a temperance that so many in the empire could not hope to match.
