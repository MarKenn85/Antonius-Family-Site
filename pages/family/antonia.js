      The youngest of my children, Antonia did not get the chance to know her father. His death occurred soon after she was born. I was also raising several other children, so my brother and his wife, Livia, stepped in to assist with Antonia.
      <br>
      <br>
      Raised all over the Empire, from Italia to Greece, even as far as Egypt for a time, her education is well above the norm as a result, and her understanding of imperial politics is extensive.
      <br>
      <br>
      Though I feel she has become somewhat hardened as a result. Unsurprising, given that to govern in this world, one must be strong and unbreakable, and she has been surrounded by political leaders most of her life.
      <br>
      <br>
      Antonia is a shining example of beauty and elegance, and I have watched her become a celebrated woman in the empire.
      </p>

      <p>
      It made me happy when she married her late husband, Nero Claudius Drusus. He was a fine man and utterly dedicated to his wife, who gave him several children. We were truly saddened by his loss after that terrible accident.
      <br>
      <br>
      Since then, I have seen and heard of her in the company of a great many men. It was always clear her beauty and grace were highly sought after, along with the Antonius name, and while she is more than happy to accept these advances, her private life remains just that—private.
      <br>
      <br>
      I never hear scathing rumors about her, and her reputation has never been besmirched by accusation or scandal. It truly gladdens me that she has kept her proclivities out of the public view. Though I wish she would learn to not be quite so… stimulating, at night. Perhaps I need thicker pillows.
      </p>

      <p>
      Thanks to Nero, she is the mother of our family's Pater Famiglia, and my dear grandson, Damion-Draco Antonius. He is such a sweet boy to me.
      <br>
      <br>
      Although his relationship with his mother is not one of the greatest fondness, it is of the deepest respect, however.
      <br>
      <br>
      She wasn't the best mother, and he wasn't the most disciplined child, but she did instill, in all her children, the values and principles this family is built around.
      <br>
      <br>
      Now, with her children all grown, Antonia spends a great deal of time away from Rome. I receive numerous letters from her often, telling me of the things she has seen and experienced.
      </p>

      <p>
      Many times, she travels with her sisters, Selene and Airiana, exploring the exotic imports of the Empire before they reach us.
      <br>
      <br>
      I also receive more private letters from her as well. She tells me of the latest happenings in the provinces—the upheavals, conflicts.
      <br>
      <br>
      She will often meet with the local leaders, even spend the night with them, carefully extracting information that might not make it to Rome ordinarily. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I remember one letter she sent me, telling me of how she had heard of a local magistrate dealing with a rival's pathetic attempts to usurp his power.
      </p>

      <p>
      She offered to speak with this would-be usurper and attempt to calm his ambitions. Knowing who she is, the magistrate was more than willing to accept her offer.
      <br>
      <br>
      So she visited the man at his modest home, unannounced, and proceeded to assuage him of his political desires.
      <br>
      <br>
      Replacing them with more base desires, and lesser ambitions that left him more malleable and easy to control.
      <br>
      <br>
      In a single night, she gracefully swept through and gained both a political puppet and the favor of a magistrate. Both of which have proved to be valuable assets.
      </p>

      <p>
      I have passed some of this information along to my brother on many occasions. He is often baffled and always asks how I could know all these things.
      <br>
      <br>
      "A woman knows many things, dear brother," I say. If he didn’t trust me so, I suspect he would have me quietly investigated to find out how I know so much.
      <br>
      <br>
      My dearest Antonia is the epitome of Roman elegance and beauty, while also a great player of the political game.
      <br>
      <br>
      Her cunning, abilities and intelligence have led her to become a very important woman of her generation. She has come far, and I believe the Roman Empire will go even further because of her.
