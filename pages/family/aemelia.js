      <p>
      My eldest daughter with my husband, Gaius Claudius Marcellus, Aemilia, is what one might consider the matriarch of the Antonius family.
      <br>
      <br>
      Though she does not hold the same level of authority as my grandson, Damion, her word still carries significant weight within the household as a true daughter of Rome.
      <br>
      <br>
      She was first married to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, a dedicated military soldier and extremely loyal to my brother. Octavian held Agrippa in very high regard also, and it was this bond that led to his selection as my daughter's husband.
      <br>
      <br>
      Like many first marriages, theirs was motivated by political strategy, however, it is no secret that the pair were good to, and for, each other.
      </p>

      <p>
      Later, when my brother's son-in-law died leaving my niece widowed, it was decided that Agrippa would be better suited to her. Thus, he divorced Aemilia.
      <br>
      <br>
      While she understood and accepted this political move, it was a disappointment for her. She returned to me and the rest of our family soon after.
      <br>
      <br>
      Not long after, Iullus Antonius, the son of my late husband Marcus Antonius and his wife Fulvia, was proposed as a worthy husband to my daughter.
      <br>
      <br>
      This marriage seemed agreeable to all, especially since Octavian favored Iullus, perhaps with some… minor assistance from me. They had several children and were very happy together.
      </p>

      <p>
      Sadly, this happiness did not last. Some years later, allegations were brought forward saying that Iullus had been unfaithful.
      <br>
      <br>
      Octavian's daughter, who had remarried once again, was in an unhappy marriage and Iullus apparently stepped in to protect her and her children, leading to infidelity.
      <br>
      <br>
      Whether the accusations were true or not, it was sufficient for Iullus to be charged with treason and sentenced to death, leading him to take his own life.
      <br>
      <br>
      Aemilia was heartbroken and has never accepted the story as fact, bitterly holding on to her husband's innocence.
      </p>

      <p>
      Since then, she has taken 'Aemilia' as her given name to honor him, as it was the name Iullus used to refer to her with love and affection.
      <br>
      <br>
      When the decision came that the family would move back to Ilva to restore the family estate, Aemilia took it upon herself to oversee the construction efforts and subsequently run the household.
      <br>
      <br>
      She ensures that everything operates smoothly and with great efficiency. She even manages to keep track of and remember the names of all the servus. It's truly remarkable.
      <br>
      <br>
      One of her most vigorous duties is maintaining the Lararium. She never lets anyone else tend to it.
      </p>

      <p>
      The family's house deities mean a great deal to her, and she does her best to ensure we all adhere to the traditions and appease the Lares.
      <br>
      <br>
      I cannot fault her for it; I am proud of her efforts. Her belief in the family, what it stands for, and in Damion especially, motivates much of what she does.
      <br>
      <br>
      If Damion is strict in his adherence to family standards, Aemilia is twice that. No one dares to cross the line with her around.
      <br>
      <br>
      Even Airiana behaves like a lady around her, usually. Also, her view of Marcus' subsequent marriages shows that she holds herself to a higher social standing than the rest of her half-siblings.
      </p>

      <p>
      Despite finding such things off-putting, she still respects and tolerates the more extravagant whims of the other women in the family.
      <br>
      <br>
      She finds Selene and my girls particularly irksome with how they display their wealth.
      <br>
      <br>
      Aemilia's belief in herself and her own abilities is enough in her mind, and she finds showing wealth a waste of time and effort.
      <br>
      <br>
      However, she firmly believes in the women of the family. I think she might even hold a certain envy for Antonia and her proactive approach to life.
      </p>

      <p>
      While Aemilia would never leave Rome and its immediate surroundings, seeing her sister carry the Antonius name to the farthest reaches of the empire with honor and grace seems to make her smile.
      <br>
      <br>
      I don't think she knows just how Antonia tends to get things done.
      <br>
      <br>
      These days, with the estate running smoothly, she sometimes acts as a caretaker to me. If I fall and hurt myself, she often sees to my wounds and ensures my aches and pains are relieved.
      <br>
      <br>
      This "old woman" is very grateful to her beloved daughter.
      </p>

      <p>
      Aemilia is the most Imperial of all my children.
      <br>
      Her status as an Antonius is something she takes very seriously, and she holds everyone else to the same standards, even if she privately thinks them largely beneath her.
      <br>
      <br>
      Her position, however, dictates that she conduct herself and those around her with honor and respect, as an Antonius always should.
      <br>
      <br>
      She is an outstanding exemplar for any Antonius.
