        <p>
        I come now to the last of Selene's children. Batresh was born several years after Xal, late into the night, with unusual lights in the sky above the city.
        <br>
        <br>
        Most auspicious indeed. While her birth was one of great joy and wonder, the child herself would prove to be... shall we say, challenging.
        <br>
        <br>
        Do not mistake me, Batresh was a sweet girl, full of life and curiosity about her surroundings. However, she inherited the same temper her brother had.
        <br>
        <br>
        The only difference, where Xal would keep it in check, Batresh would not hesitate to unleash the storm.
        </p>

        <p>
        While her father's influence on her physically was evident, it seemed that her mother was more influential on her personality, only in a less refined and raw form.
        <br>
        <br>
        As she grew, she became, as all Antonius do, more invested in her possessions and appearance. She adored the finer things in life: fine clothes and jewelry, trinkets and baubles from around the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        She loved and wanted it all. Her wardrobe soon rivaled her mother's.
        <br>
        <br>
        The temper she obtained had the unfortunate side effect of leaving her open to reacting extremely to even the slightest grievance.
        </p>

        <p>
        Once, her brother Zarek bumped her as he passed by, and she flew into a rage for daring to touch her so forcefully. Their mother had to step in and quell the situation.
        <br>
        <br>
        Batresh was also not interested in education. The outside world held little interest for her beyond what it could provide her in material things.
        <br>
        <br>
        She flouted her tutors, absconding to any number of hideaways to get away from them and the guards ordered to keep her there.
        <br>
        <br>
        Juba, frustrated to no end, even wrote to me of his loss at what he could do. I sympathized and suggested that he and Selene might send the girl somewhere she would have no authority and would be forced to attend to her studies.
        </p>

        <p>
        This proved helpful as they soon had Batresh bundled off by sea to Alexandria, where she would be tutored whether she wished to be or not.
        <br>
        <br>
        She was almost 13 years of age when she arrived in the great city. Her guardians watched over her as they escorted her to the villa maintained by the Antonius family within the Royal district, next to the palace.
        <br>
        <br>
        From there, each day she traveled to various educational institutions around the city, and her education began earnestly. I'm told she hated every minute of it.
        <br>
        <br>
        To add insult to her already injured pride, her parents promised her to a Phoenician nobleman from the city of Tyre.
        </p>

        <p>
        The union was to cement Mauritania and Phoenicia as trade partners. I had met with the young boy who would become her husband.
        <br>
        <br>
        Amun was a kind boy who would clearly grow into a strikingly handsome man.
        <br>
        <br>
        Only a few weeks into her stay, Batresh was returning home to the villa after her studies. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Crossing a busy part of the main road through the city, a chariot suddenly turned the corner at high speed. The horses swerved suddenly as they saw her, and the chariot, and its driver, collided with her.
        </p>

        <p>
        She was rushed to the nearest healers outside the great library and attended to. Word was sent to Juba and Selene in Cyrene, where they were dealing with political mundanities, and they quickly took ship for Alexandria, especially as there seemed little hope of the girl's recovery.
        <br>
        <br>
        When her parents arrived, they were relieved to find their daughter still alive and might yet survive her injuries. Though it was not yet clear as she hadn't yet awakened.
        <br>
        <br>
        Where Juba fretted and worried over their daughter, Selene was quietly confident and reassured her husband that the girl would recover.
        <br>
        <br>
        Two days later, the girl opened her eyes. Her parents were with her and were, understandably, overjoyed to see their daughter returned to them.
        </p>

        <p>
        However, it was clear that something in her wasn't the same. She had changed somehow. Perhaps the injuries had left scars that couldn't be seen.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the weeks that followed, Batresh returned home to the villa and resumed her studies. While Juba had returned to Cyrene, Selene remained for a time and watched over her child.
        <br>
        <br>
        Batresh returned to her tutors without complaint and seemed genuinely interested in the lessons.
        <br>
        <br>
        Selene eventually returned home and removed the guardians from their task of watching her daughter so closely.
        </p>

        <p>
        Meanwhile, Batresh continued to devote her time to her education and, over the next few years, became more and more interested in the political sciences.
        <br>
        <br>
        She also developed a love for debate. Many afternoons were spent discussing many issues with scholars and philosophers.
        <br>
        <br>
        To this day, as the time for her to be married draws closer, Batresh continues to reside in Alexandria and has developed into a highly learned scholar.
        <br>
        <br>
        While I have spent little time with the girl myself, I can only imagine the accomplishments she will turn out and I am certain she has a bright future indeed.
