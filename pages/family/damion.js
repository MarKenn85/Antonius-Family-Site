        While Iullus Antonius may have died in disgrace, he had the foresight, several years prior, to name his successor in his last will and testament.
        <br>
        <br>
        The son of my daughter, Antonia Minor and Nero Claudius Drusus, and my grandson, Damion Draco Antonius was named Pater Famiglia of the Antonius family. I was thrilled, and Damion proved he was worthy of the succession, as he continues to do.
        <br>
        <br>
        His upbringing was not what many would consider ideal. It could even be argued that Damion was a most troublesome child. So much so, it was even suspected he was responsible for a fire that threatened an entire sector of the Palatine Hill.
        </p>

        <p>
        Of course, when the praetorian guards, familiar with his antics, came with the intent of taking him away for questioning, he had the entire household supporting him, for he had been at home the entire time. Although I remember that he had a perfect view of the Palatine from his room, and he did give a smirk when the guards left.
        <br>
        <br>
        Damion has always been cunning and devious, even as a child. Plotting his way in and out of situations, his tongue is as sharp as his wit and intellect. As a result, he has grown to be a master of the political game and employs strategies of misdirection and subtlety with far more skill and effectiveness than most of his peers in Rome.        
        </p>

        <p>
        Extremely protective of the family, Damion will go to great lengths to ensure the security and well-being of anyone in the family.
        <br>
        <br>
        Should one of us fall prey to the schemes and machinations of a rival, Damion will see that all parties reach an equitable outcome.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've noticed that sometime after events such as these, those who threatened one of the Antonius seem to disappear without a trace usually. Though there has been the odd occasion where they are found dead. Mangled and broken. Damion always comments on what an “unfortunate accident” or “sad tragedy” it is. He’s such a kind, sensitive boy.
        </p>

        <p>
        While I speak of his more undesirable attributes, I must point out that it all stems from his love and respect for his family. He supports everyone in any way he can, whether it's getting them out of trouble or helping them plan new initiatives to improve some aspect of the empire. Even the simple planning of a celebration or party will elicit support from him. If someone wishes to do something, he will be there to help, however he can.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another I should mention here is Zane. This child-like man is a most unusual person. I have never encountered his like before. While away at battle, Damion's father wrote to us saying he found this child in the rubble of a village he and his men destroyed.
        </p>

        <p>
        He didn't have the heart to kill the babe, so he arranged for him to be sent home and raised to be Damion's personal servus.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would never mention this out loud, but I cannot help but notice the striking resemblance Zane has to Damion.
        <br>
        <br>
        This boy has been, while loyal and obedient, even more trouble than Damion ever was. Even Damion's son, Nero, hasn't been this much trouble. He has a propensity towards disturbing activities that I would prefer to go unnoticed.
        </p>

        <p>
        His mind is clearly somewhat broken and he has never truly matured as an adult. However, Damion keeps him around and seems to maintain a fairly tight leash. Most of the time.
        <br>
        <br>
        While I cannot say that I have always agreed with the choices Damion has made in his role as Pater, I also cannot deny that his methods prove fruitful. He is a fine leader, and a good man at his core. He holds his family to high standards, and does not brook dissent within its ranks for long.
        <br>
        <br>
        I tell you, the reader, should you find yourself with problems of any kind, turn to Damion. He will help you, he will support you, he will guide you. Listen to him. He is wise beyond his seeming few years.
        </p>

        <p>
        Should you even come to some issue with him directly, or with the family in its entirety, I implore you, seek him out and talk it through. I have seen too many times how failing this has caused more harm than good for everyone involved.
        <br>
        <br>
        Damion is a man of principle, kindness, and high moral standing. He is cunning, dangerous, and not to be transgressed. And though he is leading us into a future I will never see, I rest easy knowing the family is in good hands.
        <br>
        <br>
        I love Damion very much. He is my dearest grandson. I am pleased to embarrass him every time when I tell people that I am impressed with, and admire him greatly.
